# About

I am a software developer who is enthusiastic about many subjects, including algorithms, computer graphics, analog/digital electronics, science, and engineering.

I use this space to organize my thoughts on various subjects, which may be incomplete or inaccurate, but may still have value for those willing to excercise a bit of skepticism.

Source code for all demos can be found [here](https://github.com/zvxryb/zvxryb.github.io/tree/master/arcade/lib).
