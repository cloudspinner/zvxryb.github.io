title: Old Code - Graphy
---
I wrote this graphing program a while ago (2011?) to test WebGL.  At the time, WebGL had only just been released and was still experimental in the browsers which supported it.

Graphy plots complex functions of two real values (x and y).  The green surface represents the real part of the result, while the red surface represents the imaginary part.  A hatching effect is used as a simple order-independent transparency (OIT) solution.

<div id='graphy-demo'></div>
<script>
	(function() {
		var script = document.createElement('script');
		script.addEventListener('load', function() {
			graphy_demo('graphy-demo');
		});
		script.type  = 'text/javascript';
		script.async = true;
		script.src   = '/arcade/graphy/graph.js';
		document.head.appendChild(script);
	})();
</script>
